# 8-puzzle-solver
Solve the 8 puzzle in three ways

# UCS - Uniform Cost Search
> A variant of Djikstra's algorithm, this uses the lowest cumulative cost to find a path from the source to the destination.

> Time Complexity: O(C*/ε+1)

> Space Complexity: O(C*/ε+1)

# BFS - Breadth-first search

> Searches each level first to find the shortest path

> Time Complexity: O(|E|) = O(b^d)

> Space Complexity: O(|V|) = O(b^d)

# DFS - Depth First Search

> Goes down each branch to the lowest branch then backtracks to next branches to find a solution

> Time Complexity: O(V)

> Space Complexity: O(b^m)
